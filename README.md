# OS CPU Scheduling Algorithms

This project has implemented four scheduling algos:
- FCFS
- SJF
- RRA
- LJF

**Add the arrival time and burst time for different processes you want to consider for the implementation of the algorithm by entering arrival time, Burst time and then click on ADD.**

**Deletion of an entry is possible from table if you want by clicking on DELETE.**

**Select the algorithm according to which you want schedule the processes which you have added to the table by selecting the particular Click button.**

**After adding all processes and selecting the scheduling algorithm click on RUN button which will find turn around time, response time, completion time and waiting time for all processes. Also, line graphs for the response time, completion time and waiting will be displayed in an organised fashion with Gantt Chart.**
